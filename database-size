Check db size – large database

For very big databases where the size run into multiple GB or TB, below command will help you get a bird’s eye
view on the database size, used space and free space.

Please Note: this query rounds off the output and hence does not show you the exact utilization
------------------------------------------
col "Database Size" format a20
col "Free space" format a20
col "Used space" format a20
select round(sum(used.bytes) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 ) || ' GB' "Database Size"
, round(sum(used.bytes) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 ) -
round(free.p / 1024 / 1024 / 1024) || ' GB' "Used space"
, round(free.p / 1024 / 1024 / 1024) || ' GB' "Free space"
from (select bytes
from v$datafile
union all
select bytes
from v$tempfile
union all
select bytes
from v$log) used
, (select sum(bytes) as p
from dba_free_space) free
group by free.p

####### Exact database size

The size of the database is the space the files physically consume on disk. You can find this with

select
"Reserved_Space(GB)", "Reserved_Space(GB)" - "Free_Space(GB)" "Used_Space(GB)",
"Free_Space(GB)"
from(
select 
(select sum(bytes/(1014*1024*1024)) from dba_data_files) "Reserved_Space(GB)",
(select sum(bytes/(1024*1024*1024)) from dba_free_space) "Free_Space(GB)"
from dual
);

========== Schema wise exact DB size

SELECT OWNER, 
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES) / 1024 / 1024 /1024, 2) AS SIZE_GB
FROM DBA_SEGMENTS 
GROUP BY OWNER 
ORDER BY SIZE_GB DESC;

========== Schema wise exact TABLE size

SELECT OWNER, 
       SEGMENT_NAME, 
       SEGMENT_TYPE, 
       ROUND(SUM(BYTES) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS SIZE_MB 
FROM DBA_SEGMENTS 
WHERE OWNER = 'FOODPROD' AND SEGMENT_TYPE='TABLE'
GROUP BY OWNER, SEGMENT_NAME, SEGMENT_TYPE 
ORDER BY SIZE_MB DESC;



Analyzing query output

When you run the above query, you will see below output

Reserved_Space(GB) Used_Space(GB) Free_Space(GB)
------------------ -------------- --------------
        1.43491124     1.34488439     .090026855
We can see that 1.4 GB is the allocated space across all the data files in the database. Out of the 1.4 GB allocated segments,
1.3 GB is used and 0.09 GB is free space.



###### Check users & space used

We can even check the amount of disk space used by users inside the database using below query

select owner, sum(bytes)/1024/1024 Size_MB from dba_segments
group  by owner;
