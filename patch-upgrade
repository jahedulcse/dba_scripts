---------------

cd $ORACLE_HOME/OPatch

./opatch version

In my case the OPATCH version is 12.2.o.1.17 and we need the minimum OPATCH version to be 12.2.0.1.30.

$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/
$mv OPatch OPatch_bkp

Upgrade OPATCH
Upgrade the OPATCH utility, just unzip the newly downloaded opatch utility version in ORACLE_HOME directly.


$unzip /u02/p6880880_190000_Linux-x86-64 -d $ORACLE_HOME/
Once the above command is completed then check the OPATCH version again.

$ ./opatch version
OPatch Version: 12.2.0.1.35
OPatch succeeded.
